# HRTF Explorer
The HRTF Explorer is a GUI that uses OSC commands to communicate with the Binaural Rendering Toolbox (BRT).

It is primarily an example of how one would use Python (using OSC commands) to render binaural audio using the BRT.

BRT application:

# Installation
Firstly you should install the latest release of the BRT (currently I have only tested this with v1.3.1) here: https://github.com/GrupoDiana/BRTLibrary/releases/tag/v1.3.1

Then create a virtual environment and pip install the requirements to install the rest of the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will then need to need to define the absolute paths and HRTFs you want to load in the configuration file (config.yml). This should include the path of the BerTA.exe file in the BRT application. You can load in more or less than three HRTFs at a time but be aware that the more HRTFs you load the longer it will take for the BRT toolbox to finish loading all HRTFs.

```
brt_dir: "C:/Program Files/University of Malaga/BRT Application/BeRTA.exe"

hrtf_dir: "C:/GitHubRepos/HRTF_explorer/hrtfs/"
hrtfs:
  - "sofa_1.sofa"
  - "sofa_2.sofa"
  - "sofa_3.sofa"
```
You can also configure other settings in the explorer here as well if you wish (for example the port the OSC sends and receives on as well as the audio used).

The explorer has some example HRTFs you can use straight out of the box, but if you would like to test out more, the SONICOM dataset has 100 HRTFs in the SOFA format (with more to be released in the future) here: https://www.axdesign.co.uk/tools-and-devices/sonicom-hrtf-dataset

To run the application you will then just need to type the below into the command line whilst in the root directory of the repository and the virtual environment in which you installed the dependencies:
```
python hrtf_explorer.py
```
Then select the correct audio device in the BRT application in the pink drop down near the top left of the program.

You are then free to play and change the settings of the source, listener and HRTF. Enjoy!
